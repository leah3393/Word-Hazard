(A simple -- yet amazing -- word game based off of Lexathon! )

By: Brendan Burns, Leah Ferrell, Suhrud Kulkarni, and Xi Zhang

To RUN:

1. Make sure everything is in the SAME FOLDER. (In other words, just download the .zip and extract)
2. Open MARS from the folder.
3. Open runProg.asm
4. Navigate to the Settings menu in MARS.
5. Make sure "Initialize Program Counter to global 'main' if defined" is checked.
6. ASSEMBLE program
7. RUN!
8. Enjoy :)

Troubleshooting:
If you get the error: "Error in: Invalid program counter value: 0", make sure you have done steps 4 and 5.

Currently supported on the following operating systems:
- Mac OSX
- Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (any version that will run MARS, really)

Limitation: Not currently supported on Linux
